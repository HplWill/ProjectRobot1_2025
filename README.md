# ProjectRobot1_2025
ProjectRobot1_2025 is an intelligent robot car project developed using Micro:bit and Python (MicroPython).
The project follows the Agile (Scrum) methodology and demonstrates a complete software–hardware integration process through four iterative sprints — from initial planning to final implementation and presentation.

The goal of this project is to build a programmable robot car capable of:

Directional movement (forward, backward, left, right)

Speed control (user-defined speed via Micro:bit inputs)

Path following (autonomous navigation)

Agile collaboration and version control through GitHub
